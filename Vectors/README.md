## Introduction

Vectors are a dynamic array in C++ provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). Unlike regular arrays, vectors can resize automatically when elements are added or removed, making them a flexible tool for managing collections of data.

In this section, you will find various examples demonstrating how to effectively use vectors in C++.
